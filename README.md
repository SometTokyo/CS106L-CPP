# CS106L
Standard C++ programming course from Standford University, Spring, 2023.

This course adopted the style of modern C++ from the outset, with a focus on C++11 and supplemented with some content from C++14 and 17. Since the course had limited coverage and practice on polymorphism, I used "C++ Primer" as a supplementary resource and worked on a high-quality project based on polymorphism.

##Schedule
1. Welcome!
2. Types and Structs
3. Initialization and References
4. Streams
5. Containers
6. Iterators and Pointers
7. Classes
8. Template Classes and Const Correctness
9. Template Functions
10. Functions and Lambdas
11. Operators
12. Special Member Functions
13. Move Semantics
14. std::optional and Type Safety
15. RAII, Smart Pointers, and Building C++ Projects

## Programming Assignments
There are three small projects in this repository.

Two of them come from the cs106l course:

**WikiRacer**: Implement a famous mini-game in C++ that finds the path between the starting and ending entries using Wikipedia.

**HashMap**: Implement a template class container similar to std::unordered_map<K, V> in C++. It has similar features and robustness, such as generics, basic function functionality, iterators, etc.

**AP1400-2-HW5**: A small project implemented in C++ using polymorphism. It's one of the assignments from the AP1400-2 course. Please check the link [here](https://github.com/courseworks).
